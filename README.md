# Quick start

### One-click deploy

[![Deploy to Cloudflare Workers](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/shuaiplus/nodewarden)

**Deploy steps:**

1. Sign in with GitHub and authorize
2. Sign in to Cloudflare
3. **Important**: set `JWT_SECRET` to a strong random string (recommended: `openssl rand -hex 32`)
4. KV namespace and R2 bucket will be created automatically
5. Click **Deploy** and wait for it to finish
6. After deploy, open the Cloudflare-provided Workers URL (your service URL), and register on the web page

> ⚠️ **Reminder**: always use a strong random `JWT_SECRET`. Weak secrets may put your account at risk.

### Configure your client

In any Bitwarden client:

1. Open **Settings**
2. Choose **Self-hosted environment**
3. Set **Server URL** to your Worker URL (for example: `https://your-project.your-subdomain.workers.dev`)
4. Save, then go back to the login screen
